3D DOM Inspector for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

**NOTE: Only tested in Firefox so far. Help with cross-browser support is welcome.**

## Install
From your browser, enable developer mode (or equivelant) and install the extension from the `dist` folder.

## Development
`yarn build-all` to build all the versions of the extension. You can use [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) to help develop for Firefox.
